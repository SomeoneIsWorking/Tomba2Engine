// tests/test_frame_cadence.cpp — the frame-cadence owner's own state machine.
//
// WHAT IS UNDER TEST: tomba::FrameCadence, the owner of "how many display fields one Tomba! 2
// logic frame spans" and of the observation of the guest's own dwell counter. The recovery and the
// instruction words are in game/core/frame_cadence.h; tools/frame_cadence_census.py is what holds
// the constants to the image. This test is about the OWNER's behaviour on top of them.
//
// Every case here is a case that WOULD fail. The gate's own `sltu` at 0x80050CD8 is reproduced as
// a truth table over the counter. The central case is the one this class exists to get right: the
// port must NOT write the counter, because the guest's own incrementer (LAB_800506B4, vsync
// callback slot 4) already runs in this product through the port's own sequencer tick. A port that
// increments the counter as well would count every field twice and then check a number it
// manufactured itself. The u16 wrap is checked because the image's `sh` has it, and the accounting
// denominators are checked because a cadence that drifts silently is the defect this class exists
// to prevent. The last block is the 60 fps arithmetic: one field per logic frame is what the
// threshold has to hold for, and the owner already publishes and reports that one number.
