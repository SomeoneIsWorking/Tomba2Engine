# Representative free-roam input after the third checkpoint: held buttons and game-frame counts.
# The first segment repeats the released pad the checkpoint parked with (Playback's precondition).
#
# A recorded .pad replay CANNOT be used here, which is worth stating because it is the obvious idea.
# `runtime/psx/pad_input.h` records that replays are "only valid from boot" — they are one mask per
# pad-service frame from reset — while this schedule starts at a checkpoint the driver reached with
# its own input, and the console reference is stepped by VBlank and realigned to the guest's vblank
# gate every frame. There is no frame mapping between the two that survives a boot loader running
# across gates, and a wrong mapping would feed the two cores different input and report it as a
# product divergence.
#
# So the route is scripted, and its length and variety are the coverage. Tomba walks left away from
# the landing spot and back right (short of the fisherman, whose dialogue would take the pad),
# jumps standing and while walking, crouches, uses the attack and the jump-attack, walks the far
# side of the clearing, and opens and closes the in-game item menu -- which is the only segment that
# leaves free roam, and is included for exactly that reason: a menu is a different task and a
# different leaf machine, and comparing it exercises code the walk cannot reach.
