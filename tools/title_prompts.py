"""title_prompts.py — WHICH pad button a given Tomba! 2 screen is asking for, as a pure function.

Two drivers play this title and they must not disagree about the answer:

  * `tools/oracle_tomba2.py` drives the product over the framework REPL, which BLOCKS the game
    between commands, and feeds the same script to an independent console reference.
  * `tools/live_play.py` drives it over the live debug server while it keeps presenting.

The menu sequence is TITLE knowledge, not transport knowledge, so it lives here once and both drivers
ask it. A second copy inside the live driver would be free to answer a different prompt than the REPL
one, and the difference would surface as "the live run could not reach gameplay" with nothing to
compare against — the worst possible shape for a finding.

Each `Step` is the DECISION: which button this screen wants, how wide a press, and the guest state
that says the leg is done. Each driver delivers it in its own transport, and each transport adds only
what its clock needs:

  * REPL/console: `compare.tap(button, period, width)` — a per-GAME-frame input pattern, so the cadence
    is exact by construction.
  * Live: `tap <button> <width>` once per observation, never in the observation right after the screen
    changed. Its clock is a socket round trip, not a frame, so it paces presses by what it can observe
    rather than by a frame grid; `drive_to_gameplay` in tools/live_play.py says why, with the
    measurement.

WHY THE CADENCE IS 6-OF-12 AND NOT "hold Cross until something happens". The title is a TWO-PAGE
menu (docs/tomba2-newgame.md §1, verified there by cursor and screen capture): page 1 offers
NewGame (left) / LoadGame (right) and page 2 offers StartGame (left) / Options (right), and BOTH
pages confirm with Cross. So a single press advances one page, and the route has to press twice
before the GAME stage latches — a cadence of one press every 12 frames delivers both confirms
inside the ~25 frames the product's own REPL `newgame` policy takes (measured: GAME at frame 25,
tools/gate.py `boot`). Holding one press until the stage changed would confirm page 1 and then sit
there. The same cadence, in the same numbers, is what `game/core/auto_drive.cpp` ships in C++ for
`PSXPORT_AUTO_SKIP`/REPL `newgame`; that is the product owner of the policy and this module is the
driver-side statement of it, deliberately kept in step with it.

THE ADDR BELOW ARE NOT INVENTED. Each carries the source that owns it, and
`verify_address_owners` re-reads those sources so a stale constant is reported rather than used.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT DECIDED HERE: anything that would destroy the operator's data to reach a
screenshot (a save-slot overwrite prompt, a memory-card format prompt). This route only ever
confirms NewGame/StartGame on a cold boot, which writes nothing.
