# Project goals

This repository hosts two isolated Tomba ports. They share `psxport`, not a game engine. Factual
coverage belongs in `project-state.md`, migration order in `migration.md`, atomic work in `issues/`,
and placement in `codemap.md`.

## G001 — Playable Tomba! 2 native/dynarec PC port

**Outcome.** Tomba! 2 runs from user-supplied game content as one PC product: readable native C++
owners implement deliberately ported behavior and `psxport` Lightrec dynamically executes every
remaining guest instruction.

**Why it matters.** Full gameplay does not need to be manually rewritten before the authenticated executable/overlay evidence
can leave the product. A runtime dynarec provides complete guest coverage while native ownership grows
at verified subsystem boundaries.

**Success conditions.** A fresh `./run.sh` launch reaches ordinary representative gameplay without a
guest-source emission step; resident and colliding-overlay overrides plus scoped original calls work
through image-aware runtime dispatch; Lightrec executes nonzero blocks and invalidates them correctly;
the gameplay product contains no guest instructions at bodies or interpreter-first gameplay selector;
bounded fallback is reason-counted and below its declared conformance threshold; input, audio, saves,
movies, menus, transitions, timing, and relevant device behavior are
verified against independent evidence on each released host.

**Constraints and non-goals.** Restricted assets remain user supplied. Boot, logos, menus, or isolated
leaf calls do not establish gameplay conformance. The retired guest-source path is not preserved as a second
product, fallback, or permanent oracle. Runtime interpretation is permitted only as `psxport`'s bounded
automatic fallback for translation failure or unavailability, unsafe fetch, or rare unsupported blocks.
Forced interpreter mode is diagnostic-only; fallback-covered execution proves neither gameplay
conformance nor performance.

**Contributing state items.** S001, S002, S003, S007, S014, S015, S016, S017, S018.

## G002 — Tomba! 2 native wide and interpolated presentation

**Outcome.** Tomba! 2 renders from game-owned scene state through its native renderer, supports true
widescreen, and presents correctly interpolated frames between simulation ticks.

**Why it matters.** Native scene ownership is the common prerequisite for a wider view, real depth,
and stable interpolation without reconstructing meaning from GTE, ordering-table, or GP0 output.

**Success conditions.** Every visible layer has an attributed game-state producer; widescreen shows
additional correctly projected content with correct culling and anchored 2D layout; interpolation
uses stable previous/current camera, object, and effect state through the same render path as real
frames; representative real-game runs and controlled independent-oracle legs establish the picture
and cadence through the Lightrec product.

**Constraints and non-goals.** Render code does not write guest memory. Guest packets and GTE output
are diagnostic evidence, never picture inputs. Missing producers remain explicit rather than gaining
a family-wide fallback or renderer special case.

**Contributing state items.** S004, S005, S006.

## G003 — Playable, engine-isolated Tomba! 1 native/dynarec port

**Outcome.** Tomba! runs from user-supplied `SCUS_942.36` content through its own title engine and the
shared `psxport` Lightrec executor.

**Why it matters.** Co-location is organizational convenience only. The title retains its grounded
startup and CD behavior while gaining complete runtime guest coverage without a second guest-source product.

**Success conditions.** The Lightrec product reproduces the recorded 35-field CRT0 boundary, crosses
the current CD/movie frontier, reaches the title screen, accepts input, and passes representative
interactive gameplay; its six engine-neutral native overrides and scoped original calls use complete
image identity; no offline-emitted guest source or interpreter-first gameplay mode exists; bounded
fallback is reason-counted below its declared threshold; no Tomba! 2 guest
address, game source, renderer assumption, or compatibility adapter crosses the title boundary.

**Constraints and non-goals.** Tomba! 1 code lives under `titles/tomba1/`. Its guest-source path is
already removed; measured binary behavior remains as evidence. Tomba! 2 must complete
its migration first. Forced interpreter mode is diagnostic-only, and fallback-covered execution is
not gameplay-conformance or performance evidence.

**Contributing state items.** S008, S009, S010, S012, S018.

## G004 — Tomba! 1 true widescreen without unrelated enhancement modes

**Outcome.** Tomba! 1 supports true widescreen through its own projection, visibility, edge-coverage,
and 2D-layout owners.

**Why it matters.** A wider view is the selected presentation enhancement for this title; unrelated
renderer and cadence systems would add false compatibility paths.

**Success conditions.** The running Lightrec product preserves faithful 4:3 presentation and displays
additional correctly projected world content at wide aspect ratios; visual culling and authored UI
anchors are handled explicitly; the title exposes no interpolation, temporal-history,
title-native-renderer, native-producer, native-depth, 60fps, or native-rendering option.

**Constraints and non-goals.** Widescreen is not host stretching, cropping, or reconstruction from
post-projection data. The shared `psxport` renderer remains the platform presentation owner.

**Contributing state items.** S011, S013.
