// every access exactly as the guest does, so it can never go stale across a call — the same idiom as
// game/world/collision_resolve.cpp's Rec.
//
// IT LIVES IN THE HEADER ON PURPOSE, and the setters are deliberately ONE-LINERS: tools/port_check.py
// harvests a lens setter's mem_wN widths by regex to count `compose.setElem(...)` as the store it
// performs, and that harvester scans `game/**/*.h` ONLY. A lens defined in the .cpp is invisible to
// it, so every store made through it silently vanishes from the width sequence and the method FAILs
// with a store count far short of the oracle's. A setter that grew a second statement or a nested
// brace would fail the same way. (Both traps were hit while porting this very function.)
