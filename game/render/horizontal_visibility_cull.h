// game/render/horizontal_visibility_cull.h — the title's HORIZONTAL VISIBILITY CULL, as recovered
// from the authenticated images, owned once.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. A widened picture is only as wide as the narrowest bound that decides what may
// appear in the new margin, and the workspace discriminator WIDENED BUT ... MARGIN IS NOT COVERAGE is
// exactly that failure. Tomba! 2 had no survey of its own, so nobody could say how many bounds there
// were, which of them were literals, and which of them the port had actually widened. This is that
// survey's result, as code.
//
// THE RECOVERED PREDICATE. A scan of all 29 authenticated code images
// (3,823,581 B, 955,895 words; 520,754 words — 54.5% — attributed to a walked function body by
// control-flow reachability from a prologue) for frame-derived constants, and grouped the hits by the
// body containing them. 125 body instances, in 96 structurally distinct bodies, make a compare
// against a 4:3-derived value. Of those:
//
//   70 structurally distinct bodies (99 instances) are CULLING OWNERS. Each makes one screen-edge
//   compare per primitive CORNER, UNSIGNED, OR-ed, with the X gate and the Y gate AND-ed. The
//   representative is guest 0x8003B320 (MAIN.EXE, the quad submitter), read instruction by
//   instruction at 0x8003B438:
//         lhu   $v0, 8($a3)        ; corner 0 SX
//         sltiu $v0, $v0, 0x140    ; SX < 320, UNSIGNED
//         bnez  $v0, KEEP          ; any corner inside -> keep
//         ... corners 1, 2, 3 the same, each branching to KEEP
//         ... then the same four against 0xF0 for SY, each branching to KEEP
//   and the drop target is taken only when BOTH gates fail. Some owners are the 3-corner (triangle)
//   form, some the 16.16 form applied to the raw 32-bit GTE SX1/SX2/SX3 registers — e.g. A0L
//   0x80112E70, `lui $t9,0xf0; sltu $t8,$v1,$t9; ... lui $t9,0x140; sll $v1,$v1,0x10; sltu` — which is
//   the SAME predicate in a different representation, not a different owner.
//
//   20 bodies are LAYOUT, not culling: they compare a SIGNED value (`slti`) against 320/240, so a
//   negative coordinate PASSES, or they compare against the projection centre 160/120. A bound a
//   negative coordinate passes is a position limit, not a visibility test.
//
//   6 bodies are NEITHER: a single edge compare with no per-corner structure.
//
// THE THREE PROPERTIES THAT MATTER, and all three are recovered rather than chosen:
//
//   1. THE COMPARE IS UNSIGNED. `sltiu`/`sltu` against 320 means a projected coordinate that wrapped
//      negative reads as 0x8000..0xFFFF and FAILS the test. That is why the guest drops geometry to
//      the LEFT of and ABOVE the screen, and it is not a bug to be tidied away: reproducing it is
//      what makes the widened cull identical to retail inside the 4:3 region. A signed compare here
//      would be a different owner with a different picture.
//
//   2. THE GATES ARE OR-OVER-CORNERS, THEN AND-OF-AXES. Keep iff (some corner X inside) AND (some
//      corner Y inside). A quad straddling the right edge survives on its left corners; a quad
//      entirely off both edges does not. Reproducing the gates as a single bounding-box test would
//      change which primitives survive at the boundary.
//
//   3. NO OWNER DERIVES ITS BOUND. A second scan looked for reads of the DRAWENV the guest itself
//      publishes (PutDrawEnv copies 92 bytes to the "current env" cache at 0x800A59B0, and its +4/+6
//      are the clip width/height). Across all 29 images it found ZERO definite reads: every
//      screen-edge bound in Tomba! 2 is a literal 320 or 240. So there is no derived bound that
//      already widens, and a port that widens must supply the widened value itself. This owner takes
//      the draw width as an INPUT for that reason, and that is the whole design.
//
// WHY THE VERTICAL BOUND IS A CONSTANT AND THE HORIZONTAL ONE IS NOT. The projection publication is
// guest 0x800509B4, read from the binary: it calls the libgte InitGeom at 0x80083FF8, then
// SetGeomOffset(160, 120) at 0x800846D0 with a0=0xA0 and a1=0x78 in its delay slot, then
// SetGeomScreen(350) at 0x800846F0 with a0=0x15E, caching H=350 at 0x801003F8. The framework's
// projection is sx = OFX + ir0*(H/Sz) (external/psxport/runtime/psx/native_projection.cpp), so the
// visible horizontal half-extent at depth Sz is OFX*Sz/H and the horizontal field of view is the
// ratio OFX/H. Widening OFX at unchanged H grows the frustum by exactly the canvas ratio and leaves
// the vertical field of view and the central scale alone; OFY and H are untouched by the widening, so
// the vertical extent is 2*120 = 240 whatever the canvas width is. The horizontal extent is
// 2*OFX and therefore MOVES. One of the two bounds is a function of the canvas and the other is not,
// and this class is built on that fact rather than on a pair of literals that happen to match today.
//
// 4:3 IDENTITY. At drawRight() == 320 this class's decision is bit-identical to the guest's for every
// input, which is the contract the tests pin. It is not "close to" retail; it is the same predicate
// with the same domain on the same numbers, and a widened run differs from 4:3 only in the bound.
//
// PURE, DELIBERATELY. No Core, no Render, no globals, no environment reads: the bound arrives as an
// argument so the class is decided by pure arithmetic and tested hermetically, the way
// page_gradient.h is. The Core-taking factory lives in the .cpp and is the only thing that knows the
// framework's wide-engine width.
