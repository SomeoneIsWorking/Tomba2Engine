// game/core/frame_cadence.h — class FrameCadence, the ONE owner of Tomba! 2's frame-rate decision.

// WHAT THE GUEST'S OWN LEVER IS. Recovered from the authenticated resident image
// (SCUS_944.54 → MAIN.EXE, text [0x80010000,0x800AE800), Ghidra headless; the instruction
// words below are the image's own). FUN_80050b08 — the StrPlayer main loop crt0 reaches by
// `jal` at 0x800896E0 — paces every displayed frame through a vblank gate INSIDE its loop body:
//
//   80050C8C  A6C0809C  sh    zero,-0x7f64(s6)   ; DAT_800e809c  = 0   (s6 = 0x800F0000, u16)
//   80050CB0  0C01E22B  jal   0x800788AC        ; per-frame state update
//   80050CB8  0C014798  jal   0x80051E60        ; task scheduler -> builds the OT
//   80050CC0  0C0203DB  jal   0x80080F6C        ; DrawSync(0)
//   80050CC8  3C031F80  lui   v1,0x1f80
//   80050CCC  96C2809C  lhu   v0,-0x7f64(s6)    ; v0 = DAT_800e809c
//   80050CD0  90630235  lbu   v1,0x235(v1)      ; v1 = DAT_1f800235
//   80050CD8  0043102B  sltu  v0,v0,v1         ; v0 = (dwell counter < quota)
//   80050CDC  10400006  beq   v0,zero,0x80050CF8  -> release the gate
//   80050CE0  3C04800F  lui   a0,0x800f
//   80050CE4  9482809C  lhu   v0,-0x7f64(a0)    ; spin: reload the counter
//   80050CEC  0043102B  sltu  v0,v0,v1
//   80050CF0  1440FFFC  bne   v0,zero,0x80050CE4  -> keep spinning
//   80050CF8  0C0141B4  jal   0x800506D0
//   80050D08  1072FFDC  beq   v1,s2,0x80050C7C   -> next pass
//
// The counter's ONLY incremental writer is libapi's VSyncCallback slot 4, installed by the
// loop's own init at 0x80050BA8 (`jal 0x80085BB0`, a0 = 0x800506B4). FUN_80085BB0 forwards
// (4, cb) to the libapi service slot at 0x80085BC4, which FUN_80085CB4 filled with the return
// value of FUN_80086230 — 0x800862F4, the registrar whose body is
// `(&DAT_800abdc0)[slot] = cb`. The registered body is a pure incrementer:
//
//   800506B4  3C03800F  lui   v1,0x800f
//   800506B8  6C628064  lhu   v0,-0x7f64(v1)    ; v0 = DAT_800e809c
//   800506C0  24420001  addiu v0,v0,1
//   800506C4  5C628064  sh    v0,-0x7f64(v1)    ; DAT_800e809c = v0 + 1
//   800506C8  03200008  jr    ra
//
// It runs once per vblank because it sits in the 8-slot vsync-callback table at 0x800ABDC0,
// which the vblank interrupt handler FUN_80086288 walks (game/core/libapi_intr.cpp owns that
// handler natively).
//
// THERE IS A SECOND WRITER FAMILY, OUTSIDE THE RESIDENT IMAGE. The six sites above are every
// reference in MAIN.EXE, and they are not every reference in the game. Scanning the 28 provisioned
// overlay images for the same address-forming idiom finds it in two of them, at byte-identical
// looking code (file offsets, load bases not established — see tools/frame_cadence_census.py, which
// reports these as what they are):
//
//   A0L.BIN +0x0099AC  0xA062019C  sb    v0,0x19C(v1)   ; DAT_1f80019C = 2  (StrPlayer "swap")
//   A0L.BIN +0x0099B8  0xA462809C  sh    v0,-0x7f64(v1) ; DAT_800e809c = 1
//   DEMO.BIN +0x001040 0xA062019C  sb    v0,0x19C(v1)
//   DEMO.BIN +0x00104C 0xA462809C  sh    v0,-0x7f64(v1)
//
// Each is preceded by `lui v1,0x800F` (0x3C03800F) and `li v0,1` (0x24020001). So the guest does
// have a per-frame cadence lever — it is just not the quota byte. It SHORTENS AN INDIVIDUAL FRAME
// by writing the dwell counter to 1, which releases FUN_80050b08's gate after one vblank instead of
// two, while setting the swap-mode byte so the loop takes its 0x80050D00 `DAT_1f80019c == 2` arm
// (PutDispEnv, mode back to 1, parity flip). It never changes the rate; it changes one frame's
// duration. Whether either body is REACHED in this product is not measured, and the header states
// that rather than the other way round. This is why consumeVblank() below only READS the counter:
// a guest write mid-frame is a real value the guest chose, and overwriting it would erase the one
// piece of guest-authored cadence the game still has.
//
// WHAT THE GATE IS, AND IS NOT. One full pass of per-frame work runs per gate release, and
// NOTHING in that pass reads the quota: the pass is
// counter-reset -> FUN_800788AC -> FUN_80051E60 -> DrawSync(0) -> gate -> FUN_800506D0 ->
// PutDispEnv/PutDrawEnv/DrawOTag -> flip parity. The quota therefore does not scale, weight or
// gate any work; it is a pure RATE LIMITER. One logic frame per N vblanks is 60/N Hz of logic
// on a 60 Hz vblank, so the guest's own 60 fps mode is this byte equal to 1. That is why the
// port owns the byte rather than reimplementing a cadence around the loop.
//
// THE QUOTA IS A BOOT-TIME CONSTANT. A census of every reference in the resident text
// (tools/frame_cadence_census.py) finds exactly TWO sites for 0x1F800235 in the whole image:
//
//   80050A1C  24020002  li    v0,0x2           ; addiu v0,zero,2
//   80050A20  A0620235  sb    v0,0x235(v1)      ; the ONLY store, inside FUN_80050a0c
//   80050CD0  90630235  lbu   v1,0x235(v1)      ; the ONLY load, the gate's threshold
//
// The guest has NO runtime 30/60 switch: the literal `2` is compiled into the instruction word.
// The port is therefore the only thing that can decide, and this class is where it decides.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT A `declareOverride`. 0x80050CC8..0x80050CF4 is a LABEL inside FUN_80050b08's
// body, reached by falling through, never by `jal`/`jalr` — the framework's image-scoped native
// contract (psxport/AGENTS.md, "An override key names a function entry that guest code reaches
// by jal/jalr") makes it ineligible as an override key, and the enclosing FUN_80050B08 is
// itself never dispatched by this product: psxport's native_boot calls GameRuntime::bootInit,
// which runs FUN_80050b08's INIT PREFIX and then hands iteration to TombaFrameDriver. So the
// gate's instructions do not execute here, and declaring an override for them would declare
// something with no reachability. What the port can own, and does, is the gate's STATE: the two
// guest fields the comparison reads, advanced through the guest's own mechanism.

  // THE PORT WRITES THIS FIELD EXACTLY ONCE PER LOGIC FRAME, and that write is the guest's own:

  // increments it. The guest's incrementer is LAB_800506B4 in vsync-callback slot 4, and in this
  // product it genuinely runs — the port parks LibapiIntr::runVblankCallbacks at 0x80086288 into
  // libsnd's user-callback slot DAT_800AC430 (game/audio/sequencer.h), the per-field sequencer
  // tick at 0x800909C0 calls whatever is in that slot, and libsnd's SsSetTickMode (0x80090750,
  // which calls FUN_80085BB0 at 0x800908E4) is what installed the game's callback into slot 4.
