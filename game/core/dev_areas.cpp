// dev_areas.cpp — the game's area index for the DEV WARP selector (GameHooks::devAreaCount /
// devAreaName / devWarpAllowed). Game-side on purpose: the framework must #include no game header and
// must not know a Tomba guest address, so the area count, the names and the "is a warp legal right now"
// test all live here and reach the framework only through the hook table.
//
// COUNT: 22 areas, ids 0..21. Established 2026-07-22 (kanban #24) three independent ways — 22 A0*.BIN
// files on the disc, 22 entries in every one of MAIN's six per-area handler tables, and GAME.BIN's
// next-table zeroed at 22/23. Area load is file index `area + 3` into the stride-8 table at 0x800BE118,
// which is [0]=OPN [1]=CRD [2]=SOP [3..24]=A00..A0L [25]=START [26]=DEMO [27]=GAME — so an id >= 22
// loads START.BIN into the mode slot and produces out-of-range CD reads. The selector therefore cannot
// offer one; that is the UI half of kanban #36.
//
// NAMES: an area index is a fact, an area name is a CLAIM and needs a source (the USER, or a name found
// in guest data). Two cards were filed against invented names before this rule existed — #24 against an
// "area 22" that does not exist, and #26 against a "Temple interior" that is the ghost pig boss arena.
// So an unnamed area shows as "Area N" here rather than a guess. See docs/areas.md; add a row there in
// the same commit as a name added below.
