// FUN_800517BC (diagonal-scale matrix write) is owned by `NodeXform::seedBlock`
// (game/render/node_xform.cpp), which is the real wired dispatch target for that address
// (registered via NodeXform::registerOverrides into the global override registry). This class used to carry an
// unused, uncalled duplicate implementation (`Mtx::diagonal`) — deleted 2026-07-08 (dual-ownership
// found via codemap; dead code, zero callers).

// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Wiring. The trampoline is the whole guest ABI for this leaf: matrix address in a0, and v0 = 4096.
//
// v0 is NOT incidental. The guest body computes the 0x1000 diagonal constant into r2 and stores
// it from there, so the guest function returns 4096 as a side effect of how it was compiled. The
// native writes the constant directly and would otherwise leave v0 holding whatever the previous
// call left — a difference no RAM compare can see, but one that a caller reading the return value
// would. Set it explicitly rather than relying on a leftover.
// EXPECT AN OVHIT COUNT MISMATCH ON THIS ADDRESS, and do not read it as a divergence. A 1500-frame
// SBS run reports native=20269 oracle=26738 alongside a 50/50 byte-identical compare. The gap is the
// ~6.5k calls that already-ported callers make as `mtxOf(c).identity(...)` — a direct C++ method call
// that never passes through the guest function, so the registry cannot count it. Core B, being pure
// substrate, reaches every one of them through guest 0x80051794 and counts them all. The mismatch is
// therefore a measure of how much of this leaf's caller set is already native, and it should GROW as
// more callers are ported. `ovhit`'s "control-flow divergence" label is right for a target whose
// callers are all still guest code and wrong for one like this.
