// game/ai/tilt_follower.cpp — TiltFollower::applyHalvedOwnerPartPitch, guest 0x80125FE0 (A00).
//
// WHAT IT DOES, IN GAME TERMS
// An object attached to a larger jointed thing takes its own pitch from one of that thing's moving
// sub-parts — at HALF the angle. So when the part swings through its full arc, the follower leans
// through half of it: it visibly reacts to the motion without matching it, the way something resting
// on or hanging off a moving arm would. Then, if anything is currently in contact with the follower,
// it runs one further sub-behaviour (0x80125C4C); with no contact it does nothing else that frame.
//
// The whole body is four steps:
//   1. read the owner's sub-part SLOT 1 X Euler angle (the part's pitch),
//   2. WRAP it from the unsigned 0..4095 turn into a signed -2048..2047 one,
//   3. HALVE it and store it as this node's own rotX,
//   4. call 0x80125C4C only if the node's contact byte is non-zero.
//
// HOW IT WAS IDENTIFIED (from the caller and from fields other subsystems already named)
//   * ITS CALLER NAMES ITS ROLE. The only non-dispatch-table reference in all of authenticated executable/overlay
//   evidence is
//     overlay guest 0x80125E0C (authenticated executable/overlay evidence), the per-object behaviour handler
//     already owned as game/ai/beh_pure_substate_dispatch.cpp. That file's own banner enumerates the
//     dispatch: "STATE 1 : … then node[5] -> 0/FUN_80125FE0, 1/FUN_801255CC, 2/FUN_80125800". So this
//     is substate 0 of outer state 1 of that behaviour, invoked with a0 = the node.
//   * THE DESTINATION FIELD WAS ALREADY NAMED, INDEPENDENTLY. +0x54 is rotX in game/object/actor.h's
//     Actor lens (`int16_t rotX() const { return (int16_t)c->mem_r16(obj + 0x54); }`), RE'd long
//     before and unrelated to this port. So the store target is the node's X rotation, not a guess.
//   * SO WAS THE SOURCE FIELD. owner+0xC4 is the +0xC0 sub-part pointer table at slot 1 — the same
//     table AssemblyNode::childPtr and NodeXform::propagate walk — and +0x08 of a sub-part record is
//     childEulerX in game/render/node_xform.cpp's CHILD-role lens (line 87), likewise RE'd earlier
//     and for another purpose. Two independently-established names meeting at one function is what
//     makes this reading evidence rather than inference.
//   * WHAT I DID NOT ESTABLISH, and so did not put in the name: WHICH object this is, and whether its
//     owner is specifically a pump assembly. The +0x10 owner / +0x2B contact / +0xC0 sub-part shape
//     is shared by several families here (see game/ai/assembly_rider.h), and no RAM dump was scanned
//     for this node's handler. The name says what the function DOES, which is measured, not what the
//     object IS, which is not.
//
// THE ARITHMETIC, AND WHY IT IS A WRAP
// The guest does `if (!(angle < 2049)) angle |= 0xF000;` and then `(angle << 16) >> 17` arithmetic.
// That reads like bit-twiddling and is actually two ordinary operations:
//   * ORing 0xF000 into a value in [2049, 4095] produces exactly `value - 4096` in two's complement
//     (2049 -> 0xF801 = -2047; 4095 -> 0xFFFF = -1). PSX angles are 4096 units per turn, so this is
//     the standard "past half a turn counts as negative" wrap. Values already negative, and values
//     at or below 2048, take the branch and are left alone.
//   * `<< 16` then arithmetic `>> 17` sign-extends the low 16 bits and shifts right one — i.e. halve
//     the wrapped angle, rounding toward negative infinity as `sra` does.
// Doing the wrap BEFORE the halving is the point: halving an unwrapped 3000 would give 1500 (a
// quarter turn the wrong way) instead of the correct -548.
//
// TRUE EXTENT: [0x80125FE0, 0x80126038). The body's single epilogue is L_80126030 (restore ra from
// sp+16, sp += 24), and the recorded binary evidence's trailing duplicate `return;` after it is the usual
// dead-tail artifact, not a second function — authenticated instruction extents agrees and trims
// nothing here. Deliberately NOT established from "the next gen function in the shard": that test is
// false on this project (the shard split is not address order) and has produced a wrong answer four
// times in this session.
//
// MODULE: defined only by the A00 overlay (`overlay guest 0x80125FE0`, authenticated executable/overlay evidence), so
// it registers with A00 tomba::native::declareOverride. Using the main-module tomba::native::declareOverride would
// leave the direct `overlay guest 0x80125FE0(c)` call site in its caller on the substrate.
//
// GUEST STACK: frame 24, one spill (ra at +16) — mirrored via GuestFrame, per "MIRROR THE GUEST
// STACK". Nothing else is live across the one call, so no GuestReg proxies are needed here.
