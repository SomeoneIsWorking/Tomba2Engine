// game/ai/sway_schedule.h — the SWAY SCHEDULE: a field object that rocks back and forth, whose
// rocking WINDS DOWN in stages as the area's scripted event sequence advances.
//
// See sway_schedule.cpp for the identification evidence. This header holds only the two typed lenses
// the leaf needs — the object node, and the two save-block bytes the schedule waits on — plus a named
// constant per field, so the body reads as "the sequence has reached step 7, so start slowing the
// rocking down" rather than as a chain of mem_r8(0x800BF870 + 0x170).
//
// The write accessors are deliberately ONE-LINERS: tools/port_check.py harvests a lens setter's
// mem_wN width by regex and counts `self.setRate(v)` as exactly the store it performs, but ONLY for
// lenses defined in a game/**/*.h header whose setters are single statements. A setter that grew a
// second statement or a nested brace would silently stop counting, and the gate would then compare a
// short store sequence against the oracle's full one (see docs/findings/tooling.md).

// The rocking object's node. Standard object-node shape (game/object/actor.h): +3 is the per-object
// TYPE index, +5 the sub-state/jump-table selector Actor calls `triggerSub`.
//
// +0x50 IS NOT actor.h's `accelY` FOR THIS FAMILY. The three sway bodies this leaf tails into
// (0x8012CF4C / 0x8012D05C / 0x8012D16C) use +0x4A as a 4096-unit ANGLE accumulator (`& 0xFFF` every
// tick) and add +0x50 to it each frame — and they early-out doing nothing at all when +0x50 is zero.
// So in this family +0x4A/+0x50 are an oscillator phase and its per-frame step, not actor.h's
// velY/accelY. Offsets in the 0x48..0x5A block are reused per object family; this lens names them
// only for the family measured here.
