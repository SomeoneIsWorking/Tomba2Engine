// game/ai/assembly_node.h — typed lens over the MULTI-PART ASSEMBLY node driven by guest
// FUN_8012EB54, and over the child records it animates.
//
// WHAT THE OBJECT IS: the seaside water pumps are instances of this class — a long diagonal beam with
// a curved arm, a hanging bucket and a counterweight. Established by observation (docs/findings/ai.md):
// `ents` at pad frame 6424 of replays/bugs/seesaw-weight.pad shows nodes 800FB858 (x=5562) and
// 800FB960 (x=6678), both cmds=12, matching kanban #8's independently-derived pump positions;
// 800FB960 is the node Tomba's attach pointer targets when he hangs on it. Simpler instances of the
// same class live elsewhere in the area with cmds=3/7.
//
// WHY A LENS AT ALL. The twelve leaves of this orchestrator are byte-exact port_gen transcripts, and a
// body where every read is `c->mem_r16(c->r[17] + 96)` cannot show you a state fork — which is the
// whole difficulty of kanban #8, where a sub-part that should move does not. Naming the fields once,
// here, serves all twelve; four are ported and eight remain.
//
// SCOPE DISCIPLINE: this lens carries ONLY fields whose meaning is established, and each says where
// that comes from. An offset is not an identity — the same +0x30 is a 16.16 Y on one record and a
// plain Y on another (docs/findings/object.md) — so nothing is added here on the strength of "it looks
// like a position".
//
// port_check FOLLOWS THIS LENS: it harvests one-line write-accessors from game/**/*.h and counts a
// setter as the stores it performs (port_check.py:138-160). Keep every setter a single line with its
// mem_wN visible, or a converted body will silently stop being gate-able.
