// game/ai/assembly_rider.h — the ASSEMBLY RIDER: the small object that perches on one arm-end of a
// seaside water-pump assembly, rides it, hops when the pump starts a stroke, and is flung off when
// the pump commands the arm it is sitting on. Plus the typed lenses its per-frame handler needs.
//
// THREE FILES, THREE DIFFERENT OBJECTS — do not confuse them:
//   * game/ai/assembly_node.h    — the ASSEMBLY itself (guest behaviour FUN_8012EB54): the seaside
//                                  water-pump / seesaw, a long diagonal beam with a curved arm and
//                                  two identical hanging end-parts. 12 sub-parts.
//   * game/ai/assembly_companion.h — the jointed actor the assembly SPAWNS and parents to itself
//                                  (handler FUN_80136D9C); it performs a camera routine per stroke.
//   * THIS file                  — a rider that is NOT spawned by the assembly. It is an ordinary
//                                  PLACED field object (resident handler FUN_8004C238 =
//                                  beh_visibility_gate_dispatch, sub-type byte +0x5E == 6) whose
//                                  +0x10 owner link points at an assembly. Its per-frame leaf is the
//                                  area-0 arm of that dispatcher's sub-type-6 case (0x80118B10).
//
// HOW THE RIDER IS IDENTIFIED — MEASURED ON LIVE STATE, not inferred from the neighbourhood.
// Scanning the committed 2 MB RAM dumps for nodes whose +0x1C handler slot is 0x8004C238 finds
// EXACTLY TWO with sub-type +0x5E == 6, identical across every area-0 dump
// (scratch/raw/bucket_f470.bin, c18_free.bin, hud_free.bin, save_prompt.bin):
//
//   node 0x800EDF38  tag(+0x62)=200  slot(+0x18)=3  sceneTag(+0x2A)=10  class(+0x0C)=5
//                    owner(+0x10)=0x800FB858   pos (5727, -1912, 5548)
//   node 0x800EDFC0  tag(+0x62)=204  slot(+0x18)=2  sceneTag(+0x2A)=1   class(+0x0C)=5
//                    owner(+0x10)=0x800FB960   pos (7061, -1767, 3942)
//
// BOTH owners have 0x8012EB54 in their own +0x1C — they ARE the two pump assemblies this project has
// been chasing since kanban #8 (their x positions 5562 / 6678 are the same two nodes
// docs/findings/ai.md matches to the pump x-bands, and 0x800FB960 is the one Tomba's ride/attach
// pointer targets). And the owners' sub-part tables resolve the ride exactly:
//
//   0x800FB858 childPtr(3) = 0x800F308C at (5727, -1757, 5548)   <- rider 0x800EDF38 sits here
//   0x800FB960 childPtr(2) = 0x800F3378 at (7061, -1612, 3942)   <- rider 0x800EDFC0 sits here
//
// X and Z match the rider EXACTLY and Y is ~140 above, which is precisely what the leaf writes. Both
// of those sub-parts carry the SAME model pointer (sceneData 0x801C8F58) while every other slot of
// the assembly carries a different one — i.e. slots 2 and 3 are the assembly's two identical arm-end
// parts, one rider perched on each. The state-0 init's tag->(slot, sceneTag) table reproduces the
// live bytes above exactly (200 -> slot 3 / tag 10, 204 -> slot 2 / tag 1), so the init is confirmed
// to have run and to mean what it reads like.
//
// WHY class 5 MATTERS: Cull::enqueueByClass (game/render/cull.cpp) routes class 5 to CULL QUEUE C,
// and the only submit this leaf performs is Cull::enqueueQueueC (0x80077EFC). The node's own class
// byte and the queue its handler pushes to agree, which is an independent check on the reading.
//
// port_check FOLLOWS THESE LENSES: it harvests one-line `void` write-accessors from game/**/*.h and
// counts a setter as the stores it performs (port_check.py find_lens_setters). Keep every setter a
// single statement with its mem_wN visible, or the converted body silently stops being gate-able.

//
// That distinction is load-bearing and is established, not assumed:
//   * ActorReward::resolvePosition (guest FUN_800702C0, game/object/actor_sm_reward.cpp) — already
//     owned — pins an object to one of its owner's linked-entity slots with the IDENTICAL idiom:

//     mem_r16(e + 0x34)`, and reads the SAME fields as 32-bit when it averages two slots.
//   * GraphicsBind::posCompose (guest FUN_8004BD64) is the engine's generic form of the same
//     operation and reads src[+0x2C/30/34] both ways too.
//   * The leaf in assembly_rider.cpp compares `(y32() - 140)` against the rider's own 16-bit posY.
//     That comparison is only dimensionally sane if this side is a plain integer; against a 16.16
//     value it would be off by a factor of 65536 and the landing test could never fire correctly.
//   * Measured: 0x800F308C reads (5727, -1757, 5548) — real world coordinates, not fixed-point.
