// game/ai/actor_object_contact.cpp — ActorObjectContact::resolveHitOrProximity, guest 0x8010E258 (A00).
//
// WHAT IT DOES, IN GAME TERMS
// Answers two questions about one actor and one object, in order, and does something different for
// each:
//
//   1. DID HE HIT IT? A leading call reports a hit; a non-negative answer means yes. Then this
//      forwards the hit onward and, if the object is the kind that reacts and is currently in its
//      ready phase, knocks it into its struck state: state 3, phase 2, counters cleared, and its
//      contact byte stamped from the published contact direction biased by 2048 — half a turn, i.e.
//      the object is pushed AWAY along the same axis the contact came in on.
//
//   2. IF NOT, IS HE MERELY TOUCHING IT? Only for objects flagged as participating, and never while
//      the actor is paused. It measures against the object's BODY RECORD rather than the object
//      node — a distinction that matters, because the two can be in different places. A horizontal
//      cylinder test (distance vs the actor's reach + 100) and then a vertical band test must both
//      pass; if they do, it computes the contact ANGLE with ratan2, publishes it to the shared
//      scratchpad slot, stamps the ACTOR's contact byte with angle >> 4, and dispatches the follow-up.
//
// The asymmetry is the interesting part: a HIT stamps the OBJECT's contact byte, while mere PROXIMITY
// stamps the ACTOR's. One says "this object was struck from there", the other "the player is leaning
// on something over there".
//
// HOW IT WAS IDENTIFIED
//   * THE SCRATCHPAD SLOT IS ALREADY NAMED. 0x1F80009C is kContactAngleSlot in
//     game/world/collision_resolve.cpp, where cylinderResolve publishes the contact angle for its
//     caller to read back. This function writes the SAME word by the same means (Trig::ratan2 of
//     -dz, dx — the identical argument order), so it is a second producer into an established
//     contract, not a new mechanism.
//   * THE ACTOR FIELDS ARE ALREADY NAMED, INDEPENDENTLY. +0x17E bit 9 is the "paused" gate
//     game/player/actor_tomba.h documents on its own interaction path, and +0x2B is the shared object
//     CONTACT byte that ContactStamp (0x80111304) produces and the pump assembly's contactWeightApply
//     consumes. Both were RE'd earlier and for other purposes.
//   * THE CALLEES PIN THE GEOMETRY. 0x80084080 is Math::sqrtLzc and 0x80085690 is Trig::ratan2, both
//     already natively owned — so the dx²+dz² feeding the first and the (-dz, dx) feeding the second
//     are a horizontal distance and a heading, not arbitrary arithmetic.
//
// WHAT I DID NOT ESTABLISH, and so kept out of the name: what the leading call 0x8010DFD8 actually
// tests (it is unported), what kind of object kind==1 is, and what the follow-ups 0x80022D08 and
// 0x8001FF7C do. The name says what this body decides, which is measured.
//
// TRUE EXTENT: [0x8010E258, 0x8010E400). The single epilogue is L_8010E3E8 (six restores from
// sp+16..sp+36, then sp += 40) and the trailing duplicate `return;` is the recorded binary evidence's dead-tail
// artifact. NOT established from "the next gen function in the shard" — that test is false here (the
// shard split is not address order) and has produced a wrong answer repeatedly this session.
//
// MODULE: defined only by the A00 overlay, so it registers with A00 tomba::native::declareOverride; the main-module
// setter would leave the direct overlay guest 0x8010E258(c) callers on the substrate.
//
// GUEST STACK: frame 40 with SIX spills (r19,r20,ra,r18,r17,r16 at +28,+32,+36,+24,+20,+16 in the
// guest's own program order). All five callee-saved registers stay GuestReg proxies rather than C++
// locals: every one of them is live across at least one of the four nested calls, and a callee
// spilling its caller's callee-saved registers would otherwise write a stale value into guest RAM.
