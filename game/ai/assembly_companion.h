// game/ai/assembly_companion.h — the ASSEMBLY COMPANION: the jointed actor that a field assembly
// spawns and parents to itself, plus the natively-owned leaf of its idle sub-state (guest 0x80138A64).
//
// The name is not new. `SubstateEdgeLeaves::spawnInnerDispatchChild` (game/ai/substate_edge_native.cpp,
// guest 0x8013892C) already calls this node "the assembly's COMPANION node"; this file follows that
// vocabulary rather than inventing a second word for the same object.
//
// NOT the same thing as game/ai/assembly_node.h. That file is the lens over the ASSEMBLY itself
// (guest behaviour FUN_8012EB54 — the seaside water-pump/seesaw class: a swinging beam with an arm,
// a bucket and a counterweight) and over the sub-part records the assembly animates. THIS file is the
// lens over the separate node the assembly SPAWNS at its own position, whose own behaviour handler is
// FUN_80136D9C. The two are linked parent->child, and the leaf below reads across that link.

// The global camera vertical-look MODE byte. It is not this companion's own state — it is a shared,
// one-at-a-time channel into the field camera, and this family is one of its only two writers in the
// A00 overlay (the other is its own sibling leaf, guest 0x80137198). The guest addresses it as
// `lui v0, 0x800C` + a signed -0x7DF displacement, which is why it reads as `+ (uint32_t)-2015` in
// generated/ov_a00_shard_*.c — grep either form and land here.
//
// WHAT READS IT, and therefore what it MEANS: CutsceneCamera::pitch (guest FUN_8006D654,
// game/camera/cutscene_camera.cpp) switches its height target on this byte in the default arm of its
// selector — 0 = the ordinary follow height, 1 = the target pulled 200 units DOWN, anything else =
// the raised/offset variants. Two more A00 functions read it as a plain "is a mode held" flag:
// ov_a00_gen_8010DBE4 and ov_a00_gen_8010CF90 both force a per-node halfword at +0x26 to -600 while
// it is non-zero instead of deriving it from the clock at scratchpad 0x1F800160. (What that +0x26
// field then FEEDS is not established — do not build on it. Neither of those two functions is
// natively owned yet.)
//
// It is UNDOCUMENTED ANYWHERE ELSE in this repo: it has zero hits in docs/, in the findings registry
// and in the journal, and although it lives at +0x19 of the 104-byte control block at 0x800BF808
// (Pool::resetControlBlock, game/world/pool.cpp), that reset only seeds +7/+40/+41, so +0x19 is

  // assembly hook 0x8018C820. That spawner goes through Placement::spawnWithParent
  // (game/world/placement.cpp, guest FUN_80072DDC) with (parent, 3, 4, 10), and THAT is what writes
  // `newNode+0x10 = parent` — the store making parent() below a fact rather than a guess. The spawner
  // then installs 0x80136D9C as the new node's behaviour handler at +0x1C, copies the assembly's

  //   the outer dispatcher (beh_pure_inner_dispatch, FUN_80136D9C) tests: role 3 routes its idle
