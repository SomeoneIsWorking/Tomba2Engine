//
// WHAT IT IS. This is the INTERACTION SCANNER. Once per call, while Tomba is in an interact-capable
// action state, it walks the scratchpad candidate list and looks for one object that is already an
// in-range candidate. If it finds one it ACTIVATES it — and that activation is what a save sign, a
// door or a pickup reacts to on its next tick.
//
// It is worth being precise about the byte it writes, because "obj+0x2b" was carried for a long time
// under the name `subFlag`, which says nothing. It is an INTERACTION STATE with three known values:
//
//     0  none          — not a candidate
//     1  in-range      — the player is close enough / facing it; set by the proximity pass
//     3  ACTIVATED     — the player has just acted on it; set HERE, consumed by the object's handler
//
// The consuming handler tests for 3 inside its sub-state switch and clears it in its render tail.
// Clearing it any earlier destroys the activation and the object latches forever — that was the
// save-sign softlock (kanban #5, docs/findings/scene.md). Knowing what the byte MEANS is what makes
// that obvious; knowing only that it is called `subFlag` does not.
//
// It also publishes the VERB at 0x800BF840 — which activation just happened — chosen by object type:
// 0x84 for the sign/plaque family (types 0x0E/0x0F/0x39), 0x85 for everything else it accepts.
