// game/player/actor_targeting.cpp — ActorTargeting::tryAcquireTarget, guest 0x8001FAE0 (MAIN).
//
// WHAT IT DOES, IN GAME TERMS
// Decides whether the actor can ACQUIRE a candidate target — near enough, and in the right direction —
// and if so publishes what the follow-up needs. Four gates, each of which returns outright:
//
//   1. The actor's walk/jump state byte must be 0. He cannot acquire anything mid-action.
//   2. HORIZONTAL REACH: the XZ distance between the two must not exceed the SUM of both bodies'
//      reaches — the same summed-reach convention ActorBump uses when it pushes two bodies apart.
//   3. VERTICAL BAND: their Y separation plus both height offsets must fit inside the summed band.
//   4. AN ANGULAR WINDOW, which is what makes this "acquire" rather than "touch". The heading from the
//      actor to the target is compared against the actor's own heading field, and the difference must
//      land in a 769-unit window offset by 1408 (angles are 4096 per turn). It is deliberately NOT
//      centred on straight-ahead — the window sits to one side — so the acquire is directional in a
//      way a symmetric cone would not be.
//
// On success, and only while the shared contact-kind slot is clear, it publishes the acquired angle
// and a SECOND value to the scratchpad, stamps the target's contact byte, and raises a global — unless
// the actor's guard byte reads 128, which suppresses that last step. The second value is one of two
// constants chosen by the TARGET's type byte (types 14 and 57 get one, everything else the other), so
// the follow-up is told what KIND of thing was acquired as well as where it is.
//
// HOW IT WAS IDENTIFIED
//   * BOTH SIDES ARE READ THROUGH THE SAME OFFSETS — +0x2E/+0x36 position, +0x80 reach, +0x84/+0x86
//     vertical — which is why the lens is shared: actor and target are the same record shape, and the
//     test is symmetric in exactly the way a two-body proximity test should be.
//   * THE FIELDS WERE NAMED ELSEWHERE, INDEPENDENTLY. +0x145 is the walk-state byte
//     CollisionResolve::classifyBodyContact gates on, +0x2B is the shared contact byte, and
//     0x1F800137 is the contact-kind slot classifyBodyContact publishes. This body reads that slot as
//     a precondition, so it sits downstream of the contact pipeline this project already owns.
//   * THE CALLEES PIN THE GEOMETRY: 0x80084080 is Math::sqrtLzc and 0x80085690 is Trig::ratan2, both
//     natively owned, so dx²+dz² into the first and (-dz, dx) into the second is a horizontal distance
//     and a heading — the identical argument order cylinderResolve and ActorObjectContact use.
//
// NOT ESTABLISHED, so kept out of the name and stated plainly rather than guessed:
//   * what the two published constants MEAN (17408 / 18432). They are written to consecutive
//     scratchpad halfwords next to the angle, so they are plainly a parameter for whatever consumes
//     the acquisition, but nothing in the tree names either value.
//   * what target types 14 and 57 are.
//   * what the global at 0x800BF840 = 68 signals, or what guard byte 128 means.
// The name says what this body DECIDES, which is measured, not what the acquisition is FOR.
//
// TRUE EXTENT: [0x8001FAE0, 0x8001FC50). Single epilogue L_8001FC34 (five restores from sp+16..sp+32,
// then sp += 40); the trailing duplicate `return;` is the recompiler's dead-tail artifact. NOT taken
// from "the next gen function in the shard", which is a false test on this project.
//
// MODULE: MAIN (generated/shard_1.c gen_func_8001FAE0), so it registers with shard_set_override — not
// an overlay setter.
//
// GUEST STACK: frame 40, five spills (r19,ra,r18,r17,r16 at +28,+32,+24,+20,+16 in program order).
// The four callee-saved registers stay GuestReg proxies: r17/r16 carry the deltas across the sqrtLzc
// call and r19/r18 the two bodies across both calls.
